## Assignment:
Create a multiple choice quiz using vanilla javascript.  The quiz must have a timer that counts down and time is deducted for wrong answers.  Correct answers will add points to the users score.  At the end of the quiz, your score will be displayed and may be saved in the local storage.  The user can click to see a list of scores from previous games and then empty the high scores or restart the quiz.
