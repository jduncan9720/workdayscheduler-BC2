## Assignment:
Create a work day scheduler using moment.js to keep track of time.  Using moment.js check time and highlight certain time blocks as past present or future.  Have data entered into the text areas saved in local storage to access on reloads etc. Most of the changes are made by adding and removing classes.  Most of my content is dynamically created.
